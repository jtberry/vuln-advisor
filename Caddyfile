# {$DOMAIN} reads the DOMAIN environment variable at runtime:
#   DOMAIN=localhost      -> Caddy uses a self-signed cert (tls internal)
#   DOMAIN=example.com   -> Caddy auto-provisions a Let's Encrypt cert
#
# HTTP to HTTPS redirect is automatic and built in to Caddy.
# No extra redirect block is needed.
